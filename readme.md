# WikiSpy

WikiSpy is a tool to monitor Wikipedia for political bias and interference by agents of a foreign power.

## #OneGigWikiChallenge

The #OneGigWikiChallenge is an Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning challenge to fit all of Wikipedia into 1 gigabyte of RAM (i.e. Data Cache or d-cache) including the images and excluding the code (i.e. the Instruction Cache or i-cache). While the size of the d-cache is capped at 1-gigabits exactly, you are free to exploit self-modifying code to store what you can in CPU instructions; extra credit for infinite cache exploitations. As of 28 June 2020, there are 6,110,947 articles in the English Wikipedia containing over 3.6 billion words so you have approximately 175 bytes per article.

The only requirement of the competition is that you release the software under a compatible license wit the Mozilla Public License version 2.0. The winner of the competition will be featured as the Wikipedia engine for WikiSpy.

## Mission and Vision

The mission of WikiSpy is to monitor Wikipedia for political bias and interference by agents of a foreign power. The Vision of WikiSpy is to make Wikipedia non-biased and factually correct.
