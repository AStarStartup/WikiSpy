# WikiSpy

WikiSpy is a tool to monitor Wikipedia for political bias and interference by agents of a foreign power. This is a new project without any working code. We are seeking contributors to help us write analyzing Use case scenarios and requirements using Markdown and StarUML.

## #OneGigWikiChallenge

The #OneGigWikiChallenge is a #TensorFlow challenge to fit all of Wikipedia into one gigabyte of contiguous RAM (i.e. Data Cache or d-cache) including the images and excluding the code (i.e. the Instruction Cache or i-cache and source code). While the size of the d-cache is capped at 1GB of contiguous RAM (67,108,864 x64 cache lines), you are free to exploit self-modifying code to store information in CPU instructions and to use as many threads as you want. As of 28 June 2020, there are 6,110,947 articles in the English Wikipedia containing over 3.6 billion words so you have approximately three 64-byte x64 d-cache lines per article, have fun.

## Mission and Vision

The mission of WikiSpy is to monitor Wikipedia for political bias and interference by agents of a foreign power. The Vision of WikiSpy is to make Wikipedia non-biased and factually correct.
