# WikiSpy

WikiSpy is a tool to monitor Wikipedia for tampering from political bias and interference by agents of a foreign power. The Vision of WikiSpy is to make Wikipedia non-biased and factually correct. The project status is pre-alpha and non-functional. WikiSpy is easiest described as a mix of Snopes and NewsGuard that tells you if a Wikipedia article is biased or factually incorrect and who tampered with the article what, when, where, and why.

## #OneGigWikiChallenge

The #OneGigWikiChallenge is a #TensorFlow challenge to fit all of Wikipedia on a modern consumer-grade laptop into one gigabyte of contiguous d-cache RAM including images and excluding CPU instructions and multi-threaded stack RAM; GPUs and TPUS are allowed but you must generate the RAM data from the 1GB of data and CPU instructions. You may use any GPUs, TPUs, etc needed to find your solution, but the end result us required to run repeatably on a modern consumer-grade laptop, which is defined as being ***at most*** similar in performance to an Intel i5 Quad-core with 8GB RAM and a 3GB Geforce 1060. As of 28 June 2020, there are 6,110,947 articles in the English Wikipedia containing over 3.6 billion words so you have approximately three 64-byte x64 d-cache lines per article, have fun.
